#KnifeGraphics
KnifeGraphics acts as a wrapper class for LWJGL's OpenGL. It allows users to 
draw with LWJGL3 just as they would with Java's native Graphics objects. Methods 
such as <code>setColor()</code>, <code>fillRect()</code>, and <code>drawImage()</code> 
can all be used in KnifeGraphics.

#KnifeColor
KnifeColor is a custom class that handles any Colors for use with KnifeGraphics. 
It acts just like Java's Color class (<code>java.awt.Color</code>), just with more Colors and 
potentially the ability to take more forms of Color values (such as floats, ints, 
hexadecimal, and binary representations of Colors).
