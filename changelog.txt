	TODO:
		- Fix drawRect(); --Currently draws in full Color, only want outline
December 15, 2016:
	ADDED:
		KnifeColor.java:
			- Another constructor to create KnifeColors in a specified ColorSpace
			- Brighter and Darker methods
			- toString, equals, and hashcode methods
			- Ability to convert to and from HSB (hue, 
saturation, brightness)

	FIXED:
		KnifeGraphics.java:
			- drawRect() now works. Uses GL_LINE_STRIP 
instead of GL_QUADS, so only the outline of the Rect is colored

December 16, 2016:
	ADDED:
		KnifeGraphics.java:
			- OS detection to start the thread properly and 
set the screen size properly

December 27, 2016:
	ADDED:
		KnifeGraphics.java:
			- Completed drawImage();
